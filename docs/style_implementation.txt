Below is the Coding Style Guide and Implementation Plan to keep your development modular and readable. Following that, I have generated a single self-contained HTML file that implements "Phase 1" of your plan: The Physics, The Rain, and The Ship, using Phaser 3 and Matter.js.

Coding Style Guide: "Comet Drifters"
To ensure the code remains readable and scalable as you move toward multiplayer, we will use ES6 Modules and a Component-Entity-Systems approach.

1. Directory Structure (Local Development) Even though the preview below is one file, your local project should look like this:

Plaintext
/src
  /config
    - constants.js      (Gravity settings, fuel costs, colors)
  /entities
    - Ship.js           (Player logic, input handling)
    - Comet.js          (Physics body, gravity well logic)
    - Projectile.js
  /managers
    - CometManager.js   (Spawning logic, object pooling)
    - InputManager.js   (Abstracts Keyboard/Touch/Playroom into generic actions)
  /scenes
    - GameScene.js      (Main loop)
    - UIScene.js        (Overlay for fuel/ammo)
  main.js               (Entry point)
index.html
2. Syntax Standards

Classes: Use PascalCase (e.g., CometManager).

Variables: Use camelCase (e.g., fuelLevel).

Constants: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_VELOCITY).

No Magic Numbers: Don't write x + 50 in the middle of code. Define const SPAWN_OFFSET = 50 at the top of the file or in constants.js.

3. Modularity Rule

Single Responsibility: The Ship class should not handle scoring. The Comet class should not handle spawning itself.

Input Agnosticism: The Ship should not listen for "Key A". It should listen for "RotateLeft". This allows you to swap Keyboard for Touch or Playroom Phone controls without rewriting the Ship logic.

Implementation Plan
Phase 1: The Physics Playground (Current Step)

Goal: Nail the "drift."

Tech: Phaser 3 + Matter.js.

Tasks:

Set up Matter.js world with 0 global gravity.

Implement Ship thrust (force application) and "snappy" rotation.

Generate "The Rain" (Comets spawning Top-Left, moving Bottom-Right).

Deliverable: A ship flying through a stream of rocks.

Phase 2: The Anchor (Docking)

Goal: Implement the risk/reward loop.

Tasks:

Add Fuel decay on thrust.

Add "Gravity Wells" to comets (sensors).

Implement "Hard Dock" (pressing down while matching speed).

Deliverable: You die if you don't catch a ride on a comet.

Phase 3: The Network (Playroom Kit)

Goal: Multiplayer synchronization.

Tasks:

Swap InputManager to read from Playroom state.

Sync Ship X/Y/Rotation to other clients.

Deliverable: Two browser windows flying together.

Phase 1 & 2 Prototype
Here is the functional prototype. I have synthesized the modular structure into a single file for the preview, but I have used Classes clearly to show how you should split them apart later.

Controls:

W / Up Arrow: Thrust (Consumes Fuel).

A / D / Left / Right: Rotate Ship.

S / Down: Brake / Dock (Hold this when near a Green Comet to refuel).
