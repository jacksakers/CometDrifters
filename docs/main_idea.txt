This is a solid concept. It combines the "Lunar Lander" tension (don't crash) with "Asteroids" combat, plus a King of the Hill mechanic (holding a comet to refuel).
The "Top-Left" directional rain is a great design choice—it creates a constant "flow" to the map that prevents players from camping in one spot forever.
Here is a streamlined Game Design Document (GDD) tailored for the Phaser + Playroom Kit stack.
Game Design Document: "Comet Drifters" (Working Title)
1. High Concept
A physics-based, zero-gravity survival shooter where players pilot fragile ships through a diagonal rain of comets. Players must manage momentum and fuel, utilizing the gravitational pull of passing comets to dock, refuel, and engage in combat.
Core Loop: Drift $\to$ Stabilize & Dock $\to$ Refuel/Reload $\to$ Dogfight $\to$ Survive.
2. Technical Stack
Engine: Phaser 3 (using Matter.js physics engine, which is built-in).
Why Matter.js? Arcade physics is box-based. Matter.js supports circular bodies (comets) and complex gravity/attractors much better out of the box.
Multiplayer/Input: Playroom Kit.
Role: Handles lobby, state sync, and converts smartphones into gamepads.
3. Core Mechanics
A. Movement (The "Feel")
Zero-G Inertia: The ship does not stop when you release the button. You drift forever until you apply counter-thrust or hit something.
Thrust: Short bursts of acceleration. Consumes Fuel.
Rotation: Snappy rotation (not physics-based) to make aiming easier for non-gamers.
Screen Wrap: No. If you drift off-screen, you die/explode (or bounce off the edges, depending on map tightness).
B. The Environment (The Comets)
Spawn: Comets spawn top-left (off-screen) and drift toward bottom-right.
Attributes:
Size: Small (hard to land, low gravity), Medium, Large (easy land, high gravity).
Gravity Wells: Each comet has a small invisible circle around it. If a player enters, they are gently pulled toward the center.
Rotation: Comets spin slowly (visual only) or physically (affecting landing).
C. Resource Management (The "Anchor")
Fuel: Depletes when moving.
Ammo: Depletes when shooting.
Docking: To refill, the player must "land" on a comet.
Mechanic: Fly close + match speed $\to$ press "Down" or "Interact" to magnetic clamp.
Risk: You are a sitting duck while docked, but you regain resources rapidly.
D. Combat
Weapons:
Primary: Linear laser shots (requires ammo).
Secondary (Rare): "Push" wave (blasts nearby enemies/comets away without damage).
Health: 1-hit kill (hardcore) or Shield System (3 hits). Given the "Party Game" vibe, a 3-hit shield that regenerates upon docking is more forgiving.
4. Game Modes (Dynamic Lobby)
Since you are using Playroom, the game state should adapt based on the playerCount.
State 1: Solo (The Waiting Room)
Objective: Survival / High Score.
Enemies: AI "Scavenger Drones" (Simple logic: fly toward player, shoot once, die easily).
Win Condition: How long can you survive the comet rain?
State 2: Multiplayer (2-4 Players)
Trigger: As soon as Player 2 connects via QR code.
Lobby Selection: A simple UI appears: "VERSUS" or "CO-OP".
Versus (PvP):
Last ship floating wins.
Comets are neutral cover.
Co-op (PvE):
Wave survival.
Friendly fire is ON (for chaos/hilarity).
Revive mechanic: Survive for 15 seconds to respawn your dead teammate.
5. Controls (The Low Barrier)
We will use Playroom's virtual gamepad capabilities.
Smartphone Layout:
Left Side (Virtual D-Pad or Joystick): rotate ship left/right.
Right Side (Big Button A): THRUST (Gas).
Right Side (Small Button B): SHOOT.
Double Tap A: Boost (uses extra fuel).
Keyboard (Desktop Fallback):
Arrow Keys: Rotate.
Space: Thrust.
Z/X: Shoot.
6. Visual Style
Perspective: 2D Top-down.
Art:
Background: Parallax starfield (slow movement to sell the "drift").
Sprites: Simple vector shapes or neon-outlined sprites (Geometry Wars style). This is easier for a programmer to make look good than detailed pixel art.
UI (HUD):
Fuel Gauge: A curved bar next to the ship.
Ammo: Dots around the ship.
Design Note: Keep UI near the player object so they don't have to look at the corner of the screen.
7. Technical Implementation Plan (Phaser + Playroom)
Phase 1: The Physics Playground (Solo)
Initialize Phaser with physics: { default: 'matter' }.
Create the Ship class.
Implement "thrust" forces.
Create CometManager class: Spawns circles top-left, applies velocity bottom-right, destroys them when they go off-screen.
Add collision detection: Ship vs Comet.
Phase 2: The Network (Playroom)
Import Playroom.
Change input listener: Instead of keyboard.on, use Playroom.onPlayerJoin(player => ...)
Map Playroom joystick data to Ship rotation/thrust.
Sync state: The "Host" (Player 1's browser) calculates physics. Send x,y,rotation to other players.
Phase 3: The Game Loop
Add Fuel logic.
Add Shooting.
Add "Docking" logic (if touching comet body + low velocity = refill).
8. Potential Challenges & Solutions
Challenge: Lag in multiplayer physics.
Solution: Since it's a browser party game (Playroom), assume players are likely in the same room or on decent wifi. Use Client-Side Prediction for the local player's ship so it feels crisp, and interpolate the enemy ships.
Challenge: The "Rain" makes it hard to move up-left.
Solution: Give the player a "Boost" mechanic that burns 20% fuel for a massive burst of speed to fight the current.
Next Steps for You:
Since you are ready to code, I can generate the Project Structure and the index.html file that includes Phaser and Playroom, setting up the basic "Ship floating in space" scene.
Would you like the HTML/JS Boilerplate to get this running?
